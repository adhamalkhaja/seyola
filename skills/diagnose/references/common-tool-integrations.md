## How to Use This Reference

During Level 2/3 expansion and the System Connection Map synthesis:
1. When a tool appears, check this reference for known integrations
2. Use integration data to make better inference guesses
3. Suggest specific integration methods when presenting opportunities

## Integration Opportunity Templates

Use these when presenting opportunities during the synthesis step:

### Manual Bridge → Automation

> **[Tool A] → [Tool B]**: Currently manual ([describe what user does]).
> **Fix:** [Zapier/Make/Native] integration available. Triggers on [event], automatically [action].
> **Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]

### Disconnected Tool → Connect or Eliminate

> **[Tool]**: Not connected to any other system. Used for [purpose].
> **Options:**
> - Connect via [method] to [other tool]
> - Replace with [alternative] that integrates natively
> - Eliminate if [other tool] can serve the same purpose

### Redundant Tools → Consolidate

> **[Tool A] and [Tool B]**: Both used for [similar purpose].
> **Fix:** Consolidate to [recommended tool]. Migrate [data type] from [other tool].
> **Benefit:** One less tool to manage, data in one place.

### Missing Tool → Fill Gap

> **Gap:** No tool for [function] between [Tool A] and [Tool B].
> **Impact:** [What happens without it — manual work, lost data, etc.]
> **Options:**
> - [Tool recommendation 1] — [why it fits]
> - [Tool recommendation 2] — [why it fits]
