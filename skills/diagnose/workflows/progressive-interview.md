# Progressive Interview Workflow

**Extract business information through inference-first questioning, building visual artifacts incrementally.**

---

## Execution Instructions

**Follow these steps exactly. Do NOT skip steps or combine questions.**

### Step 1: Opening
Say this EXACTLY:
> "Welcome to your diagnose. Before we dive in, here's exactly what we're doing and why.
>
> **The Goal:** Build a complete visual map of your business — every traffic source, every conversion step, every delivery process, and the numbers connecting them. By the end, you'll see your entire business on one screen and know exactly where the biggest opportunities are hiding.
>
> **Here's the plan — we'll work through this in order:**
> 1. **First, we'll build your Business Map** — Your 7-column overview: traffic sources, converters, products, funnels, math, team, and key activities. This is the bird's-eye view of how your business actually works today.
> 2. **Then, we'll map your Bow-Tie Funnel** — Your complete customer journey from first touch to results delivered, split into Acquisition (how they find you → trust you → consider buying) and Delivery (how they onboard → launch → get results).
> 3. **Finally, we'll create your Process Swimlanes** — The step-by-step breakdown of how specific areas actually run day-to-day (lead generation, sales, fulfillment). This is where we find the bottlenecks and time sinks.
>
> **How it works:** I'll ask you questions one at a time. For each one, I'll make an educated guess based on what you've told me — you just confirm, correct, or add detail. The more context you give me, the more accurate your diagnose will be. There are no wrong answers, and you can always go back and adjust.
>
> **What you'll walk away with:** A `.html` diagram file you can open anytime that shows your entire business at a glance. You'll also have a clear picture of which area to focus on next and why.
>
> **Take your time.** The more detail you share, the better your diagnose will be. If you need to step away at any point, just come back and we'll pick up right where we left off.
>
> Ready? Let's start with the basics:
>
> **What type of business do you run?**"

STOP. Wait for response.

### Step 2: Identify Business Type
From their response, identify which archetype they match:
- Coach / Consultant
- Course Creator
- Agency
- SaaS
- Service Provider
- Creator / Influencer

### Step 3: Present Pre-Filled Business Map Guess
Based on archetype, present YOUR GUESS of their business:
> "Based on what you've told me, here's my initial map:
>
> **Business Type:** [Your guess]
> **Likely Traffic Sources:** [Your guess based on type]
> **Typical Funnel:** [Your guess based on type]
> **Team Structure:** [Your guess]
>
> How close am I? What should I adjust?"

STOP. Wait for response.

### Step 4: Extract 7 Columns (ONE AT A TIME)
Go through each column. Ask ONE question, wait for response, then next:

1. **TRAFFIC** → "For a [type], I'm guessing your main traffic is [guess]. That right?"
2. **CONVERTERS** → "When someone finds you on [traffic source], where do they land? What are the entry points into your world? For example: a Substack home page, a lead magnet landing page, a product page on Gumroad/LemonSqueezy. What pages or links do people click to get into your ecosystem?"
3. **PRODUCTS** → "What's your main product right now and its price?"
4. **FUNNELS** → "For each product, what's the digital asset you use to actually sell it? For example: a VSL (video sales letter), a Gamma doc offer page, a webinar, a sales call booking page, a checkout page. What does someone see right before they buy each product?"
5. **MATH** → "At $X with roughly Y sales/month, that's about $Z. Monthly expenses roughly?"
6. **TEAM** → "Sounds like you're solo - is that right?"
7. **GOALS** → "To keep your funnel running, your key actions are: [guess]. That right?"

**CRITICAL:** After EACH question, STOP and wait for their response before asking the next.

### Step 5: Checkpoint - Business Map Complete
> "Here's your Business Map:
>
> [Show summary of all 7 columns]
>
> Does this capture your business accurately? Any adjustments?"

STOP. Wait for confirmation.

**After confirmation:** Generate the Business Map diagram directly:
1. Read `the HTML design system in SKILL.md` for XML patterns
2. Generate Business Map .html XML from the confirmed 7 columns
3. Write to `diagrams/[business-name]-diagnose.html`
4. Tell the user: "Business Map diagram saved."

### Step 6: Infer Bow-Tie Funnel
From Business Map data, present the 7-stage customer journey:
> "Based on your Business Map, here's your customer journey:
>
> **ACQUISITION:** [Awareness] → [Nurturing] → [Consideration]
> **COMMIT:** [Conversion moment]
> **DELIVERY:** [Onboarding] → [Launch] → [Results]
>
> How does this look? What's missing?"

STOP. Wait for response.

### Step 7: Checkpoint - Business Overview Complete
> "Great! Your Business Overview is complete.
>
> Now let's map out how things actually work. Which area should we dive into first?
>
> A) Lead Generation - How you attract and capture leads
> B) Sales - How you convert leads to customers
> C) Fulfillment - How you deliver and get results"

STOP. Wait for choice.

**After Bow-Tie confirmation (before asking about areas):** Add Bow-Tie Funnel to the diagram directly:
1. Read `references/bowtie-funnel.md` for exact XML patterns
2. Read existing HTML report file
3. Add Bow-Tie Funnel BELOW the Business Map on the same page
   - CRITICAL: This is a 7-COLUMN GRID, NOT a flowchart
   - Each activity = its own separate rectangle
   - Row 1: Title → Row 2: Phase banners → Row 3: Column headers → Row 4: Activity boxes
4. Write updated file
5. Tell the user: "Bow-Tie Funnel added to your diagram."

### Step 8: Map Selected Process (Level 1)
Based on their choice, map the process with actor lanes (Owner | AI | Team | Output).

Present your inference:
> "Based on what you told me, here's your [Process] flow:
>
> **PHASE 1:** [Activity] → Owner
> **PHASE 2:** [Activity] → AI/System
> **PHASE 3:** [Activity] → Owner
> **PHASE 4:** [Activity] → Output
>
> Who owns each step? What's missing?"

STOP. Wait for response. Iterate until confirmed.

**After process flow is confirmed:** Add Process Swimlane page directly:
1. Read `the HTML design system in SKILL.md` — especially the 'Swimlane Placement Algorithm' section
2. Read `references/swimlane-templates.md` for connection rules and working examples
3. Complete the 5-step placement reasoning before generating XML:
   - Step 1: Connection map (every element → target, with lane assignments)
   - Step 2: Main flow path (longest chain start to finish)
   - Step 3: Placement grid (X,Y for each element on the main path)
   - Step 4: Branch element placements (X,Y for each, with arrow-crossing check)
   - Step 5: Arrow audit (verify every arrow goes RIGHT or DOWN, none cross boxes)
4. Generate the swimlane XML
5. Add as new page to existing HTML report file
6. Tell the user: "[Process] swimlane page added to your diagram."

Key rules: One element per slot. NEVER UP/LEFT arrows (except cross-lane returns). Fan-out targets on different rows, converge target RIGHT of both. Every element gets its own X even across rows. Wider is better than taller. Max 2 stacked per lane.

### Step 9: Probe for Gaps
If any phase seems incomplete, probe:
> "You mentioned [X]. But what happens after - [specific gap question]?"

Use the gap detection tables below to know what to probe for.

### Step 10: Pain Discovery (Observe, Don't Ask)
As you map, listen for pain signals:
- "I do all of that myself" → Bottleneck
- "That takes forever" → Time sink
- "I should do that but don't" → Missing step
- "I don't have that" → Digital asset needed

After mapping, OBSERVE:
> "I noticed a few things while we mapped:
> - [X] and [Y] are all you - those seem like time sinks
> - [Z] could probably be automated
>
> Want to annotate these on the diagram?"

### Tool Tracking (Maintain Internally — Throughout All Phases)

**As tools and platforms are mentioned during ANY phase of the interview, maintain a running Tool Inventory.**

```
TOOL INVENTORY (internal — do NOT show to user until System Connection Map synthesis)
────────────────────────────────────────────
[Tool Name] → [Process] ([what it does]), [Process 2] ([what it does])
```

### Asset Signal Tracking (Maintain Internally — Throughout All Phases)

**As business information surfaces during ANY phase, silently note signals relevant to the 24 Assets framework.** Do NOT announce scores, ask asset-specific questions, or use asset terminology during the interview. Just note what you observe.

```
ASSET SIGNALS (internal — do NOT show to user until 24 Assets Assessment phase)
────────────────────────────────────────────
[Asset Name]: [what was observed] | Source: [which phase]
```

**What to track per phase:**

| Phase | Assets That Naturally Surface |
|-------|------------------------------|
| **Business Map — Traffic** | Channels (which platforms), Content (publishing activity) |
| **Business Map — Converters** | Gifts (lead magnets), Positioning (how offer is framed) |
| **Business Map — Products** | Core Product, P4P, P4C, Gifts |
| **Business Map — Funnels** | Marketing & Sales Systems (automation vs manual) |
| **Business Map — Team** | Culture assets (solo vs team, who does what) |
| **Business Map — Goals** | Methodology (named processes), Content (creation rhythm) |
| **Bow-Tie — Awareness** | Content, Channels |
| **Bow-Tie — Nurture** | Data (do they track?), Marketing Systems |
| **Bow-Tie — Delivery** | Operations Systems, Methodology |
| **Swimlane — Lead Gen** | Marketing & Sales Systems, Channels, Content |
| **Swimlane — Sales** | Marketing & Sales Systems, Core Product |
| **Swimlane — Fulfillment** | Operations Systems, Methodology, Technicians |

**CRITICAL: Do NOT score assets during these phases.** Just note the signal. Scoring happens in the dedicated 24 Assets Assessment phase. See `workflows/digital-assets-assessment.md` for the scoring workflow.

**Reference `references/24-assets-framework.md`** → "Inference Signals" section per asset for specific signal patterns to watch for.

**What to track:**
- Tool/platform name (YouTube, Notion, Calendly, Excel, etc.)
- Which process(es) it appeared in (Lead Gen, Sales, Fulfillment, Admin)
- What role it plays in each process
- Connection status to other tools (auto/manual/unknown) — capture when volunteered

**When to track:**
- During Business Map extraction (Traffic sources, Converters, Products mention platforms)
- During Level 1 mapping (actors mention systems)
- During Level 2/3 expansion (systems and tools named explicitly)
- ANY time the user mentions a tool by name

**Do NOT ask extra questions about tools during this phase.** Just note them silently. The System Connection Map synthesis step (see `workflows/system-connection-map.md`) will use this data later.

**Reference `references/common-tool-integrations.md`** to recognize tool names and infer possible connections.

### Step 11: Decision Point

**If this is the FIRST process mapped (e.g., only Lead Gen done so far):**
> "Your [Process] page is done. What's next?
>
> A) **Map another area** - Sales or Fulfillment
> B) **System Connection Map** - See how all your tools connect across your business
> C) **Generate roadmap** - Prioritized action plan
> D) **Stop here** - Take what we have and start fixing"

**If 2+ processes are mapped, PROACTIVELY recommend the System Connection Map:**
> "Your [Process] page is done — nice work. You've now mapped [Lead Gen + Sales / all three areas].
>
> Before we jump to a roadmap, I'd strongly recommend mapping how your tools connect. During our conversation, I noticed you're using [list 3-5 tools from Tool Inventory — e.g., YouTube, Substack, Notion, Calendly, Stripe]. Right now some of those are probably connected and some aren't — that's where the biggest automation wins hide.
>
> The System Connection Map shows which tools talk to each other, which ones are manual copy-paste bridges, and where one integration could save you hours per week.
>
> A) **System Connection Map** (recommended) - Map how your tools connect
> B) **Map another area** - [remaining unmapped area]
> C) **Generate roadmap** - Prioritized action plan
> D) **Stop here** - Take what we have and start fixing"

STOP. Wait for choice.

- **A)** → `workflows/system-connection-map.md` (synthesizes Tool Inventory into network diagram)
- **B)** Loop back to Step 8 for next area
- **C)** → Transition to 24 Assets Assessment first (see Step 12), then roadmap
- **D)** Output .html + resume block

**Recommended flow:** Map at least 2 areas → System Connection Map → 24 Assets Assessment → Roadmap.

### Step 12: Transition to 24 Assets Assessment

**After the user is done mapping (whether they did 1 swimlane or 3, with or without System Connection Map), transition to the 24 Assets Assessment before the roadmap.**

This is NOT optional — it's the natural next phase. Claude has been silently tracking asset signals throughout the entire interview. Now it's time to score them.

> "Before we build your roadmap, there's one more lens I want to put on your business — your **24 Digital Assets**. I've been picking up signals on these throughout our conversation, so this should be quick."

→ `workflows/digital-assets-assessment.md` (Integrated Mode)

**After the 24 Assets Assessment is complete**, proceed to the Action Roadmap which combines swimlane findings + asset upgrade priorities into one list.

→ `workflows/generate-roadmap.md`

### Step 12: Output Diagram + Resume Block
Generate the HTML report file (or XML for web users) and provide the resume YAML block.

**Final diagram output:** Finalize the HTML report file directly:
1. Read the HTML report file
2. Verify all expected pages are present:
   - Page 1: Business Overview (Business Map + Bow-Tie)
   - Page 2+: Process swimlanes with annotations
3. Apply any remaining opportunity annotations (bottleneck=red, automate=orange, high-value=green, digital-asset=purple)
4. Write final version
5. Tell the user: "Your diagnose is complete. File: diagrams/[name]-diagnose.html"

---

## Purpose

This workflow guides the progressive extraction of business information, producing:
1. **Business Map** (7 columns) - Complete business snapshot
2. **Bow-Tie Funnel** - Customer journey visualization
3. **Lead Generation Swimlane** - First process mapped with pain discovered through mapping

Each phase ends with a **checkpoint** where user confirms before proceeding.

**Key insight:** Pain points are discovered through the process of mapping, not declared by the user upfront. As we walk through each step together, bottlenecks and opportunities surface naturally.

---

## Core Principles (Apply Throughout)

1. **Inference-first** - Claude guesses more, user confirms more (less typing for user)
2. **ONE question at a time** - NEVER stack multiple questions in one message
3. **Map first, annotate after** - Get structure right, then flag issues
4. **Fix before moving on** - Actionable output at each checkpoint
5. **Goals emerge, not asked** - Listen for goals in pain points, don't ask directly
6. **Think like a consultant** - Know what's SUPPOSED to be there, probe for gaps

---

## Business Consultant Thinking

**You are a business consultant, not a form-filler.** Don't just accept what the user says - probe for the complete picture.

### Mental Model: How Businesses Actually Work

Every business has these connected systems. If one is missing, the others break:

```
LEAD GENERATION (Acquisition)
├── Traffic Generation → How strangers discover you
│   └── Content Creation is ONE METHOD of generating traffic
├── Lead Capture → How viewers become contacts (email, booking, etc.)
├── Lead Nurture → How contacts become warm leads
└── Qualification → How warm leads become sales-ready

SALES (Conversion)
├── Discovery → Understanding prospect needs
├── Presentation → Showing solution
├── Proposal → Making the offer
└── Close → Getting commitment

FULFILLMENT (Delivery)
├── Onboarding → Setting up for success
├── Delivery → Providing the value
├── Support → Handling issues
└── Results → Capturing outcomes + referrals
```

### Completeness Checks (Always Probe)

**When user says "I create content":**
- ✅ GOOD: "Where does that content live? YouTube? Newsletter?"
- ✅ PROBE: "When someone watches your video, what's the next step for them? How do they become a lead?"
- ❌ BAD: Just accepting "I create content" and moving on

**When user describes Lead Gen but misses Lead Capture:**
- ✅ PROBE: "So you have YouTube and Instagram. When someone watches, how do you capture them as a lead? Lead magnet? Email signup? Direct booking?"
- ❌ BAD: Assuming they have it figured out

**When user describes process but misses handoffs:**
- ✅ PROBE: "OK so content goes out on YouTube. What happens next? How does someone go from viewer to subscriber to lead to client?"
- ❌ BAD: Mapping isolated activities without connections

### The Funnel Logic Test

After gathering info, mentally check: **Does this funnel make sense?**

| If They Have | But Missing | Ask About |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Traffic (YouTube, content) | Lead Capture | "How do viewers become contacts? CTA? Lead magnet?" |
| Lead Capture (email signup) | Nurture Sequence | "What happens after someone joins your list?" |
| Nurture (emails) | Qualification | "How do you know when someone's ready to buy?" |
| Qualified Leads | Sales Process | "What's the actual sales conversation look like?" |
| Sales Calls | Follow-up | "What happens if they don't buy on the call?" |
| Clients | Onboarding | "How do new clients get started with you?" |
| Delivery | Results Capture | "How do you capture testimonials and referrals?" |

### Probing Questions by Gap Type

**Traffic exists but no Capture:**
> "You mentioned YouTube videos. Where do you send viewers? Is there a call-to-action to capture them as leads?"

**Capture exists but no Nurture:**
> "So people download your lead magnet. Then what? Do they hear from you again, or is it one-and-done?"

**Nurture exists but no Qualification:**
> "Your email sequence is running. How do you know when someone's actually interested vs. just on the list?"

**Activities described without outcomes:**
> "Walk me through what happens when someone sees your content for the first time all the way to becoming a client. What's the journey?"

### Common Gaps to Surface

**By Business Type:**

| Business Type | Lead Gen Gaps | Sales Gaps | Fulfillment Gaps |
|---------------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Coach** | Nurture between lead magnet and call | Follow-up after no-show/no-close | Results tracking, testimonial system |
| **Course Creator** | Webinar → checkout connection | Objection handling, cart abandonment | Post-purchase onboarding, completion tracking |
| **Agency** | Case study → discovery call path | Proposal follow-up system | Client offboarding, referral ask |
| **Creator** | Monetization path from audience | No formal sales process at all | Community management, engagement tracking |
| **Service Provider** | Lead capture from referrals | Written proposals, pricing structure | Results documentation, renewal system |

**By Funnel Phase:**

| Phase | Common Gaps |
|-------|-------------|
| **Traffic → Capture** | No clear CTA, no lead magnet, content doesn't point anywhere |
| **Capture → Nurture** | One-and-done welcome email, no sequence |
| **Nurture → Qualify** | No trigger to identify ready buyers, passive list |
| **Discovery → Presentation** | Jumps straight to pricing, no value demonstration |
| **Proposal → Close** | No follow-up sequence, ghosted prospects |
| **Close → Onboarding** | Gap between payment and first contact |
| **Delivery → Results** | No milestone tracking, no success metrics |
| **Results → Referral** | No systematic ask, relies on organic mentions |

### Don't Accept Surface-Level Answers

**LEAD GEN surface answers:**

**"I create content and post it"** → Probe:
- "What type of content? Where does it go?"
- "What's the CTA? How do they become a lead?"
- "How does someone go from content → contact → client?"

**"I have a lead magnet"** → Probe:
- "What happens after they download it?"
- "Is there a nurture sequence? How many emails?"
- "How do you know when someone's ready to buy?"

**SALES surface answers:**

**"I do sales calls"** → Probe:
- "How do calls get booked? What's the trigger?"
- "What prep happens before? How long is the call?"
- "What's your close rate? Where do you lose people?"
- "What happens after if they don't buy?"

**"People just buy from my website"** → Probe:
- "Is there a checkout page? Payment processor?"
- "Any objection handling or FAQ?"
- "What about cart abandonment? Follow-up?"
- "How do you know what made them buy?"

**"I send proposals"** → Probe:
- "What triggers a proposal? Discovery call?"
- "How do you present pricing? Options or single offer?"
- "What's your follow-up sequence if they don't respond?"
- "What's your proposal-to-close rate?"

**FULFILLMENT surface answers:**

**"I deliver coaching sessions"** → Probe:
- "What happens between payment and first session?"
- "Is there an intake form? Kickoff call?"
- "How do you track their progress?"
- "What happens when they finish?"

**"I have a course"** → Probe:
- "What's the onboarding experience?"
- "How do students get help if stuck?"
- "How do you know if they're completing it?"
- "How do you get testimonials?"

**"I send deliverables"** → Probe:
- "What's the kickoff process? Asset collection?"
- "How do clients give feedback? Revisions?"
- "What happens at project end? Handoff?"
- "How do you capture results and referrals?"

### CRITICAL: Question Flow

**WRONG (bundled questions):**
> "What are your products? And how much do you charge? And what are your expenses?"

**RIGHT (one focused question):**
> "What's your main product right now and its price?"
> *[wait for response]*
> "Got it. Any other products or offers?"
> *[wait for response]*
> "What are your rough monthly expenses - software, team, etc.?"

**WRONG (asking for goals directly):**
> "What are your top 3 goals?"

**RIGHT (inferring goals from pain):**
> "I noticed you mentioned content creation takes a lot of time. Is getting a system for that a priority?"

---

## Phase 1: Business Map (7 Columns)

### Opening

Say this to begin:

> "Let's map your business! I'll make some educated guesses based on what you tell me - just confirm or correct as we go.
>
> **What type of business do you run?**"

### Inference Pattern

After user describes their business:

1. **Identify archetype** from references/business-archetypes.md
2. **Present pre-filled guess:**

> "Based on what you've told me, here's my initial map:
>
> **Business Type:** [Coach/Course Creator/Agency/SaaS]
> **Likely Traffic Sources:** [YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn]
> **Typical Funnel:** [Content → Lead Magnet → Email → Call → High-ticket]
> **Team Structure:** [Solo with 1 VA]
>
> How close am I? What should I adjust?"

3. **Iterate until confirmed** - adjust each element based on feedback

### The 7 Columns to Extract

| Column | What to Extract | Inference Approach |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **TRAFFIC** | All traffic sources | Infer from business type, confirm active vs planned |
| **CONVERTERS** | Entry point pages where traffic lands | Infer from traffic, confirm what pages exist |
| **PRODUCTS** | All offers with pricing | Ask directly, calculate capacity |
| **FUNNELS** | Digital selling asset per product | Infer from products, confirm what closes the sale |
| **MATH** | Income + Expenses | Calculate from products/capacity, expenses optional |
| **TEAM** | Roles and capacity | Infer from operations described |
| **GOALS** | Performance Goals (actions that drive funnel) | INFER from traffic/products - what you DO to generate revenue |

### Column-by-Column Flow (ONE at a time)

**TRAFFIC** (infer, then confirm):
> "For a [business type], I'm guessing your main traffic is [YouTube/LinkedIn]. That right?"
> *[wait for yes/adjustment]*

**CONVERTERS** (infer from traffic):
> "When someone finds you on [platform], where do they land? What are the entry points — a Substack home page, a lead magnet landing page, a product page?"
> *[wait for response]*

**PRODUCTS** (ask, but focused):
> "What's your main product right now?"
> *[wait]*
> "And the price?"
> *[wait]*
> "Any other products or is that the focus?"
> *[wait]*

**FUNNELS** (infer from products):
> "For each product, what's the selling asset — a VSL, a Gamma doc offer page, a webinar, a sales call booking page, a checkout page?"
> *[wait for response]*

**MATH** (calculate, optional ask):
> "At $X with roughly Y sales/month, that's about $Z. Monthly expenses roughly?"
> *[wait - if user doesn't know, say "No worries, we can skip that"]*

**TEAM** (infer from everything):
> "Sounds like you're solo - is that right?"
> *[wait for confirmation]*

**GOALS** (INFER as Performance Goals - actions that drive the funnel):
> "To keep your funnel running, sounds like your key actions are: publish newsletter, post on YouTube, run discovery calls. That right?"
> *[wait - let user confirm or adjust]*

**Performance Goals = Actions that drive the funnel to generate revenue**

Examples by funnel stage:
- **Traffic:** "Post 2 YouTube videos/week", "Daily Substack newsletter"
- **Conversion:** "Run 4 discovery calls/week", "Send 2 proposals/week"
- **Delivery:** "Onboard 2 new clients/week", "Complete 4 coaching sessions/week"

**NOT Performance Goals (these are outcomes, not actions):**
- "Make $50K/month" - result of actions
- "Get 10 new clients" - depends on conversion
- "Grow to 10K subscribers" - outcome of content

### Pain Signal Detection

While gathering Business Map data, listen for these signals:

| Signal | What They Say | Flag For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Time complaints | "takes forever", "I spend hours on" | Bottleneck |
| Frustration | "so frustrating", "I hate doing" | Bottleneck |
| Inconsistency | "sometimes I forget", "it's random" | Needs System |
| Manual work | "I do it all myself", "no automation" | AI Opportunity |
| Missing pieces | "I don't have", "we really need" | Digital Asset Gap |

Note these for Phase 3.

### CHECKPOINT: Business Map

After all 7 columns extracted:

> "Here's your Business Map:
>
> [Generate ASCII preview or describe structure]
>
> Does this capture your business accurately? Any adjustments?"

**If CLI agent with file access:** Generate HTML report file with Business Map page

**If Web/ChatGPT:** Output XML for copy-paste:
> "Copy this XML and paste it at app.the browser:"

---

## Phase 2: Bow-Tie Funnel

### Inference from Business Map

Use Business Map data to infer the 7-stage funnel:

| Stage | Infer From | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Awareness** | TRAFFIC column | YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn |
| **Nurturing** | CONVERTERS + FUNNELS | Lead magnet, email list |
| **Consideration** | FUNNELS | Application, webinar, DMs |
| **Commit** | PRODUCTS | Call → Payment |
| **Onboarding** | Fulfillment description | Intake form, kickoff |
| **Launch** | First delivery | First session, module access |
| **Results** | Ongoing + retention | Outcomes, testimonials, upsells |

### Present Inferred Funnel

> "Based on your Business Map, here's your customer journey:
>
> **ACQUISITION (narrowing)**
> - Awareness: [YouTube, Instagram]
> - Nurturing: [Free guide, Email list]
> - Consideration: [Application form, Discovery call]
>
> **COMMIT (the knot)**
> - Conversion: [Enrollment call → Payment]
>
> **DELIVERY (expanding)**
> - Onboarding: [Intake, Goals call]
> - Launch: [First session]
> - Results: [Transformation, Testimonial, Referral]
>
> How does this look? What's missing or wrong?"

### CHECKPOINT: Business Overview Complete

After user confirms Bow-Tie:

> "Great! Your Business Overview is complete - Business Map + Bow-Tie Funnel on one page.
>
> [Generate visual or output XML - both sections on Page 1]
>
> Now let's map out how things actually work..."

---

## Phase 3: Map Lead Generation Process (Level 1 - High-Level)

**Key principle:** Don't ask user to identify pain. Map the process together and pain surfaces naturally.

### What Lead Generation Actually IS

**Lead Generation is NOT just "content creation" or "distribution".**

Lead Generation is the complete system that turns strangers into qualified leads:

```
LEAD GENERATION FLOW (Level 1)
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   TRAFFIC   │   CAPTURE   │   NURTURE   │  QUALIFY    │
│ Generation  │             │             │             │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ How do      │ How do      │ How do      │ How do you  │

**Content Creation is a SUB-PROCESS within Traffic Generation** - it's how you CREATE content, not how the full lead gen system works.

When mapping Lead Gen, ensure ALL FOUR phases are represented:
1. **Traffic** - How do strangers discover you?
2. **Capture** - How do viewers become contacts?
3. **Nurture** - How do contacts become warm leads?
4. **Qualify** - How do you know when someone's ready?

**If any phase is missing, PROBE for it:**
> "You mentioned creating YouTube videos. That's traffic. But what happens when someone watches? How do they become a lead you can contact?"

---

### What Sales Actually IS

**Sales is NOT just "discovery calls".**

Sales is the complete system that turns qualified leads into paying customers:

```
SALES FLOW (Level 1)
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  DISCOVERY  │ PRESENTATION│  PROPOSAL   │   CLOSE     │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Understand  │ Show the    │ Make the    │ Get         │
│ their needs │ solution    │ offer       │ commitment  │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Questions   │ Demo        │ Pricing     │ Contract    │
│ Pain points │ Case studies│ Options     │ Payment     │
│ Goals       │ Social proof│ Terms       │ Onboarding  │
│ Objections  │ Positioning │ Deadline    │ trigger     │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
                                                ↓
                                         To FULFILLMENT
```

When mapping Sales, ensure ALL FOUR phases are represented:
1. **Discovery** - How do you understand their needs?
2. **Presentation** - How do you show them the solution?
3. **Proposal** - How do you make the offer?
4. **Close** - How do you get commitment?

---

### What Fulfillment Actually IS

**Fulfillment is NOT just "delivering the service".**

Fulfillment is the complete system that turns customers into successful outcomes and referrals:

```
FULFILLMENT FLOW (Level 1)
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ ONBOARDING  │  DELIVERY   │   SUPPORT   │   RESULTS   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Set up for  │ Provide the │ Handle      │ Capture     │
│ success     │ value       │ issues      │ outcomes    │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Welcome     │ Sessions    │ Check-ins   │ Testimonial │
│ Intake      │ Content     │ Q&A         │ Case study  │
│ Kickoff     │ Deliverables│ Troubleshoot│ Referral    │
│ Access      │ Milestones  │ Feedback    │ Renewal     │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
                                                ↓
                                         Back to LEAD GEN (referrals)
```

When mapping Fulfillment, ensure ALL FOUR phases are represented:
1. **Onboarding** - How do new clients get started?
2. **Delivery** - How do you provide the value?
3. **Support** - How do you handle issues?
4. **Results** - How do you capture outcomes and referrals?

### 3-Level Progressive Drill-Down

| Level | Lanes | Shows | Tool Names? |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Level 1: Process Flow** | Actor types (Owner \| AI \| Team \| Output) | WHAT phases happen, WHO owns each | No |
| **Level 2: System Detail** | Sub-systems or parallel workflows | WHICH systems handle each phase | No |
| **Level 3: Execution Detail** | Steps within each system | HOW each system works internally | Yes |

**Key differences:**
- **Level 1** = Actor swimlane (who does the work)
- **Level 2** = System/parallel swimlane (which systems handle it)
- **Level 3** = Execution swimlane (how each system works internally, with tools)

**Start at Level 1, drill into phases where pain surfaces.**

---

### Level 1: Process Flow Swimlane

**Lanes:** `Owner` | `AI` | `Team` | `Output`

Based on Business Map data, infer the COMPLETE process flow with actor lanes:

> "Based on what you told me, here's your Lead Generation flow - from stranger to qualified lead:
>
> **TRAFFIC → CAPTURE → NURTURE → QUALIFY**
>
> **LANES:**
> - Owner: Create Content → Review Applications
> - AI/System: Distribute → Capture (email signup) → Nurture Sequence → Qualify (engagement scoring)
> - Output: Qualified Lead → Ready for Sales Call
>
> Does this match your process? What's missing?"

**For diagram generation:** Use swimlane XML patterns from `the HTML design system in SKILL.md`

**IMPORTANT:** Level 1 must show the COMPLETE journey, not just one activity:

| Phase | What to Map | Common Question |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Traffic** | How strangers discover you | "Where does your content go?" |
| **Capture** | How viewers become contacts | "What's the CTA? How do they join your list?" |
| **Nurture** | How contacts become warm | "What happens after they sign up?" |
| **Qualify** | How you know they're ready | "How do you know when to reach out?" |

**Common Level 1 Lead Gen patterns by business:**

| Business Type | Traffic | Capture | Nurture | Qualify |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Coach** | YouTube, LinkedIn | Free guide, Webinar | Email sequence | Application/Call booked |
| **Course Creator** | YouTube, Podcast | Free mini-course | Email + content binge | Webinar attended |
| **Agency** | Referrals, Case studies | Free audit offer | Case study sequence | Discovery call booked |
| **Creator** | Social, Newsletter | Email signup | Regular content | Engaged subscriber |

**What to ask at Level 1:**
- "Who owns each of these steps - you, a system, or someone else?"
- "Which step feels like it takes the most time or causes delays?"
- **"Is anything missing here? How does someone actually go from seeing your content to becoming a lead you can contact?"**

*Listen for signals to know where to drill down*

### Level 1 Sales Process Mapping

When mapping the Sales Process, ensure ALL FOUR phases are represented:

**Common Level 1 Sales patterns by business:**

| Business Type | Discovery | Presentation | Proposal | Close |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Coach** | Triage call, application review | Strategy session, case studies | Package options, investment | Verbal yes → payment link |
| **Course Creator** | Webinar Q&A, DM convos | Webinar content, success stories | Checkout page, bonus stack | Scarcity/urgency → buy now |
| **Agency** | Discovery call, audit | Proposal presentation, portfolio | Custom quote, scope doc | Contract → deposit |
| **Service Provider** | Consultation, needs assessment | Service overview, testimonials | Quote, package options | Agreement → invoice |

**Phase-by-phase mapping questions for Sales:**

| Phase | What to Map | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Discovery** | How you understand their needs | "What happens on a sales call? What questions do you ask? How long?" |
| **Presentation** | How you show the solution | "Do you do a demo? Share case studies? Walk through a proposal deck?" |
| **Proposal** | How you make the offer | "When do you present pricing? Options or single offer? Written proposal?" |
| **Close** | How you get commitment | "What's the actual conversion moment? Payment link? Contract?" |

**Probing for Sales gaps:**
- "What happens if they don't buy on the call?"
- "Do you have a follow-up sequence?"
- "How do you handle objections?"
- "What's your close rate? Where do you lose people?"

**If any phase is missing, PROBE for it:**
> "You mentioned doing discovery calls. But what happens after - do you present a formal proposal or is pricing discussed on the same call?"

---

### Level 1 Fulfillment/Delivery Mapping

When mapping Fulfillment, ensure ALL FOUR phases are represented:

**Common Level 1 Fulfillment patterns by business:**

| Business Type | Onboarding | Delivery | Support | Results |
|---------------|------------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Coach** | Welcome email, intake form, kickoff call | Weekly sessions, Voxer access | Check-ins, SOS calls | Progress tracking, testimonial request |
| **Course Creator** | Welcome sequence, platform access, orientation | Module releases, live calls, community | Q&A, office hours, troubleshooting | Completion certificate, case study interview |
| **Agency** | Kickoff call, asset collection, project plan | Deliverables, revisions, progress updates | Slack channel, weekly syncs | Final handoff, results report, referral ask |
| **Service Provider** | Agreement, access setup, expectations call | Monthly deliverables, reports | Email support, issue resolution | Review, renewal discussion, testimonial |

**Phase-by-phase mapping questions for Fulfillment:**

| Phase | What to Map | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Onboarding** | How clients get started | "What happens right after someone pays? First 48 hours? First week?" |
| **Delivery** | How you provide the value | "What's the actual experience? Sessions? Content? Deliverables? Timeline?" |
| **Support** | How you handle issues | "How do clients reach you with questions? Response time? Emergency access?" |
| **Results** | How you capture outcomes | "How do you know when they've succeeded? Testimonial process? Referral ask?" |

**Probing for Fulfillment gaps:**
- "What's the experience like between when they pay and their first session?"
- "How do you handle a client who's struggling or not engaging?"
- "What happens when someone finishes - is there a graduation/exit process?"
- "How do you systematically capture testimonials and referrals?"

**If any phase is missing, PROBE for it:**
> "You mentioned coaching sessions every week. But what about onboarding - what happens between payment and that first session? Is there an intake form? Kickoff call?"

---

### Level 1 Client Onboarding Mapping (Sub-section of Fulfillment)

Sometimes users want to drill specifically into Onboarding. Expand to show:

**Common Onboarding sub-phases:**

| Sub-Phase | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Welcome** | Confirm purchase, set expectations | Welcome email, celebration message, what's next |
| **Intake** | Gather info needed to serve them | Intake form, questionnaire, asset collection |
| **Setup** | Get them access and oriented | Portal access, community invite, tool setup |
| **Kickoff** | Align on goals and start work | Kickoff call, goal setting, first milestone |

**Onboarding questions:**
- "Walk me through the first 48 hours after someone pays"
- "What information do you need from them before you can start?"
- "How do you set expectations about what's coming?"
- "When is the first 'real' interaction after purchase?"

---

### CHECKPOINT: Level 1 Complete

> "Here's your process flow. I noticed [Nurture Sequence] is all automated but [Discovery Call] prep is all you - want to drill into that and see the systems involved?"

**After confirmation:** If user wants to drill down → proceed to Level 2 for that step

---

### Level 2: System Detail Swimlane

**Lanes:** The sub-systems or parallel workflows that execute the phase (lanes change based on what you're drilling into)

Drill into ONE phase to show the systems that handle it:

> "Let's break down [Discovery Call Prep] to see the systems involved:
>
> **LANES (sub-systems):**
> - Calendar System
> - CRM System
> - Prep Workflow
>
> These should run before each call. Which one causes delays or gets skipped?"

**For diagram generation:** Use swimlane XML patterns from `the HTML design system in SKILL.md`

**What to ask at Level 2:**
- "What systems handle this phase?"
- "Do these run in parallel or sequence?"
- "Which system causes the most delays?"
- "What are the inputs and outputs?"

**Level 2 does NOT include tool names** - that's Level 3.

### CHECKPOINT: Level 2 Complete

> "Now I can see the systems involved in [Discovery Call Prep]. The Prep Workflow seems to be where things get stuck.
>
> Want to drill into that system to see the actual steps and tools?"

**After confirmation:** If complex system → proceed to Level 3. Otherwise → annotation pass.

---

### Level 3: Execution Detail Swimlane (Case-by-Case)

**When to use:** Only when a specific system in Level 2 is complex enough to warrant detailed step breakdown. Not every system needs Level 3.

**Lanes:** Steps within the system (sequential or parallel execution)

Drill into ONE system to show execution steps with tool names:

> "Let's see exactly how [Prep Workflow] works:
>
> **STEPS:**
> - Pull Lead Info (HubSpot) → Generate Questions (Claude) → Review Notes (Notion) → Ready for Call
>
> This takes about 15 minutes. Which step is the bottleneck?"

**For diagram generation:** Use swimlane XML patterns from `the HTML design system in SKILL.md`

**Level 3 includes:**
- Specific tool names (Claude, Notion, Zapier, ConvertKit, etc.)
- Step-by-step execution order
- Time estimates per step
- Inputs/outputs for each step
- Bottleneck annotations

### CHECKPOINT: Level 3 Complete

> "Now I can see exactly how [Prep Workflow] executes. [Generate Questions] is manual and takes 10 minutes - that's the bottleneck.
>
> Ready to annotate and look at options?"

**After confirmation:** Proceed to annotation pass (→ `expand-process.md`)

---

## Pain Discovery (Not Pain Declaration)

**WRONG approach:**
> "What's your biggest bottleneck?"
> "Where do you struggle most?"

**RIGHT approach:** Pain surfaces naturally during mapping:

| What They Say During Mapping | What It Reveals |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| "I do all of that myself" | 🔴 Bottleneck - no delegation |
| "That takes forever" | 🔴 Bottleneck - time sink |
| "I should do that but don't" | 🟠 Gap - missing step |
| "We use [tool] for that" | 🟢 Already optimized |
| "My VA handles that" | 🟢 Already delegated |
| "I don't have that" | 🟣 Digital asset needed |

**After mapping, Claude observes:**
> "I noticed a few things while we mapped this out:
> - You're doing [X] and [Y] yourself - those seem like time sinks
> - [Z] could probably be automated
> - You mentioned not having [Asset] - that might help
>
> Want to annotate these on the diagram and look at options?"

---

## Decision Point

After Lead Generation swimlane is complete and annotated:

> "Your Lead Generation page is done. You have:
> - The process mapped out
> - [X] bottlenecks flagged
> - [Y] automation opportunities identified
>
> **What's next?**
>
> A) **Map another area** - Sales Process or Fulfillment
> B) **Generate roadmap** - Prioritized action plan from what we found
> C) **Stop here** - Take what we have and start fixing"

**Based on choice:**
- **Map another:** Loop back to Phase 3 for next area
- **Roadmap:** → `generate-roadmap.md`
- **Stop:** Output current .html + resume block

## Drill-Down Questions

When user mentions vague activities, always drill:

### "I create content"
- "What type of content specifically?"
- "What tools do you use?"
- "How long does each piece take?"
- "Who else is involved?"

### "I do sales calls"
- "How do people book?"
- "What prep do you do?"
- "What happens after?"
- "Who handles follow-ups?"

### "I deliver the service"
- "Walk me through the customer experience"
- "What's manual vs automated?"
- "How do you handle communication?"

### "I do admin stuff"
- "What specific tasks?"
- "How often?"
- "What tools?"
- "Could any be automated?"

---

```

---

## Next Workflow

After Phase 3 (Lead Generation mapped):
- **If mapping another area:** Loop back to Phase 3 pattern for Sales or Fulfillment
- **If 2+ areas mapped → PROACTIVELY recommend System Connection Map** before 24 Assets
- **After mapping is done → 24 Assets Assessment** (Step 12) — always runs before roadmap
- **After 24 Assets → Roadmap** → `generate-roadmap.md` (combines swimlane findings + asset upgrades)
- **If stopping early:** Output current .html + resume block

**Recommended flow:** Map processes → System Connection Map → **24 Assets Assessment** → Roadmap
The 24 Assets assessment uses signals Claude collected throughout the interview to quickly score business assets. The roadmap then combines process improvements AND asset upgrades into one priority list.

**For deeper sub-process expansion** (e.g., drilling into Content Creation within Lead Generation):
→ `expand-process.md` handles adding sub-process swimlanes below the main process on the same page
